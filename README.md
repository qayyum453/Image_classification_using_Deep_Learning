# Image_classification_using_Deep_Learning
Cat and Dog image classification using  Conv2D in Keras and Tensorflow

In this project i did image classification of Cat and Dog with the dataset provided by microsoft.

The dataset composed of 25k images.

where 12.5k images is of cat and other half is of dogs.

So, these are good number of Images for training our algorithm

One thing you need to know whil doing Image classification you need to have good Cpu power and also Ram.

Prefered is to use new GPU'S which works briliantly in these projects.


you can download the dataset from the folloing link.
